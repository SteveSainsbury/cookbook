    <p>Honey is superior to sugar in that it has more vitamins and minerals, is sweeter, and raises one's blood sugar more slowly. It is 
      unrefined and natural. It also will keep your baked goods moister longer. Here's how to substitute honey for the sugar in a recipe.</p>
    
    <p>To start with, it's a good idea to substitute up to half of the sugar in a given recipe. Once you've experimented more and have a 
      better handle on how it works, you can try a higher percentage of honey. Here are the principles of substituting honey for sugar:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to one cup, honey can be substituted for sugar in equal amounts. For example, you can substitute 1/2 cup of honey for 1/2 
          cup of sugar called for in a recipe. Over one cup, use about 2/3-3/4 cup of honey for every cup of sugar. This is because honey 
          is actually sweeter than sugar.</li>
        <li>Honey is a liquid, so you'll need to reduce the liquid in the recipe a little. Do this at a rate of 1/4 cup less liquid for 
          every cup of honey used in the recipe.</li>
        <li>Honey is also a little acidic. To counter-act this, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for every cup of honey used.</li>
        <li>Honey causes baked goods to brown more quickly, so reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees F and watch carefully as the 
          time gets close.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>General Rule</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>1 cup of sugar = ¾ cup honey</li>
    <li>Decrease liquid called for in recipe by ¼ cup</li>
    <li>For each cup of honey in baked goods, add ½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Attempt using ricotta made following directions in J Kenji Lopez-Alt the Food Lab.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
    <li>1000ml Milk</li>

    <li>Separate Curds and place in lined colander</li>
    <li>Drain for >2 hrs or overnight for firm cheese</li>
