This old-fashioned biscuit recipe belongs to a friend’s grandmother.

It’s the perfect snack for afternoon tea – thin, crisp and buttery with a bit of crunch. And while salted caramel has been a recent trend, this biscuit, which includes salted peanuts, proves that the combination of saltiness and sweetness is nothing new. It is undoubtedly delicious.

The flour measurements here appear in cups, as in the original recipe. I’m breaking my rule of quantifying flour by weight, and I do this in memory of all the cooks who have made these biscuits over the 100 years since this recipe was handed down.

Makes: 15 biscuits

 

Ingredients

    80g butter
    1/2 cup castor sugar
    1 egg
    1/2 cup salted peanuts
    1⁄4 cup plain flour
    1⁄4 cup self-raising flour

 

Method
Preheat the oven to 180ºC (160ºC, if fan-forced). Line two baking trays with baking paper.

Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and beat in the sugar, egg and nuts with a wooden spoon. Sift in the two types of flour and mix thoroughly.

Roll the mixture into walnut-sized balls and put on the trays, leaving room for the biscuits to spread. Flatten gently with a fork and bake for 12 minutes or until golden. Repeat with the remaining mixture, if necessary.

Cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.
