  <p id = "method">Steam the potatoes for 25 minutes or until tender, then mash with a potato masher
    while they are still hot. Stir in the flour, egg and a pinch of salt and knead to a soft, elastic
    dough. Be careful with the ratio of potato to flour: if there is too much flour, the gnocchi will
    be hard, if there is too much potato, they tend to disintegrate while cooking. Shape the dough into
    long rolls just over 15mm in diameter and cut into 20mm lengths. Press them gently against the
    underside of a grater and arrange on a tea towel dusted with flour. Bring a large pan of lightly
    salted water to the boil, add the gnocchi, a few at a time, and remove with a slotted spoon as they
    rise to the surface. Drain, put on a warm serving dish and pour your chosen sauce over them.
